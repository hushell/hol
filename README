1. Installation
---------------

The implementation splits the work into three parts: prepare, main and
collect, so that things can easily be run on a cluster for different data
sets and features. Most of the main logic is in grabcut/grabcutMain.m and the scripts
it is calling. If you want to run the main script on a cluster, I recommend
compiling it with something along the lines of the command brutus_compile.sh
(note: you'll need to adapt the mosek path in this file). The step-by-step
guide below describes the workflow assuming you compile the code.

a. obtain mpe_inference and matluster
    
    cd grabcut
    git clone git@github.com:ppletscher/matluster.git
    git clone git@github.com:ppletscher/mpe_inference.git

b. Install the mosek toolbox in a subfolder grabcut/mosek. You need the "free academic
   license". I would recommend just creating a symlink to a central place
   where you save the mosek toolbox, such as ~/mosek.

c. Obtain the images and corresponding segmentations from:
   
   http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/iseg/

   Unpack the files into a grabcut/data/ folder. The folder should now contain
   three subfolders: images, images-gt and images-labels.

d. In Matlab run the command:
   runPreprocessAll;

e. In Matlab run the command:
   grabcutPrepare;

f. On the command-line compile the main script:
   ./brutus_compile.sh

g. From the command-line submit the jobs to the cluster:
   ./submit_grabcut.sh

h. Once all the jobs have successfully completed, run the collection from
   within Matlab:
   grabcutCollect;
